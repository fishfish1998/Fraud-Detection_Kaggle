The codes written in the kaggle contest "Fraud Detection"
In this contest, we classify whether a given trade is fake or not based on the dataset. 
Document "EDA" is used for exploration data analysis.
Documents whose filename prefix is "fe" are feature engineering codes.
Documents whose filename prefix is "lgb" are used for feature selection, model training, testing, as well as result prediction based on lightgbm algorithm.
Document whose filename prefix is "xgb" is used for feature selection, model training, testing, as well as result prediction based on xgboost algorithm.
Document "catboost" is used for feature selection, model training, testing, as well as result prediction based on catboost algorithm.
